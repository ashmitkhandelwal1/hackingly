HomeBot is a WhatsApp-based property management system (PMS) built for small-scale hosts who manage homestays, boutique hotels, and Airbnb listings with limited digital infrastructure. These hosts often rely on manual tools like Excel, WhatsApp chats, and phone calls, making operations error-prone and time-consuming. HomeBot addresses this gap by offering an end-to-end conversational platform that allows property owners to add or edit property listings, block rooms, change pricing, and sync availability (mock OTA integration) across platforms — all through a simple WhatsApp interface. It supports natural language commands such as “Block Room 2 from July 1–3” using a custom NLP parser that maps user messages to backend logic, making the experience intuitive even for non-technical users. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, and MongoDB Atlas is used for scalable data storage. Twilio’s WhatsApp Sandbox is integrated to handle incoming messages and send dynamic replies in real time. Room data, bookings, property details, and guest interactions are stored in separate MongoDB schemas for clarity and scalability. Guests receive automated responses for FAQs like check-in time, Wi-Fi, or directions, and hosts get daily earnings summaries directly on WhatsApp. The system is hosted locally and tunneled with ngrok for development, with a plan to support SaaS deployment and multi-language support in future versions. HomeBot is a scalable, mobile-first solution designed to make property management seamless for the masses.
